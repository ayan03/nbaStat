        <p>Updates: Added Kevin Durant and Lebron James. Unfortunately, we are still working on the fantasy aspect of our website.</p>
        <p>Right now all we can do is order players based on their stats, but
        check back in soon and we will be able to help you with your fantasy needs</p>
